# GUM_Dispenser

A helpful tool that generates NOMNOML (nomnoml.com) output so you have a visual of your Python source code!

Thanks so much to Daniel Kallin for creating such an amazing website!
You can learn more about his project from his Github: https://github.com/skanaar

Usage: Download the latest distribution from the dist folder and install via pip.
I used Python 3.6 for this project, so you will need that version installed for everything to work properly.
If demand arises, I may make a backwards compatible version.
Feel free to fork as well!

This was designed to run from the command line.
Simply call "GUM_Dispenser" from your source directory and you will get the NOMNOML output.
